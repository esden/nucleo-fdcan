This repository contains FDCAN addon boards for Nucleo

Most Nucleo boards have the same pinout for the CAN capable microcontrollers.

The adapter board uses PD0 and PD1 pins for FDCAN TX and RX pins.

Additionally PD3 is used for the STBY pin control.

You plug it into the left connector on the Nucleo board.
